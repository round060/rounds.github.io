## Welcome
Hello! My name is Christopher Rounds and this is my website! 
I am currently a Fisheries and aquatic sciences masters student in the [Hansen lab](https://gretchenhansen.squarespace.com/) at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I work on optimizing eDNA useage in order to detect Aquatic Invasive Species! More info can be found [here](https://www.maisrc.umn.edu/edna-monitoring). I am interested in aquatic biology, limnology, Rstats and modeling.
